Um. Hello, John. Do you... *mind* if I call you John? I, I mean, you don't *actually* know me. It's just, well. "Archivist." It's so formal, isn't it?  And I do *kind* of know you...? Haven't had much choice, really. Dreams are like that, you know. No matter how lucid you think they are, there's always that part that just drags you along.

Guess I don't need to tell *you* that. At least, not right now.
