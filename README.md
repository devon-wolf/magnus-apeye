... it's supposed to be a pun.

## Archive of The Archive

This project is intended to provide a simple API for accessing, searching, and filtering Magnus Archives episodes in textual form.

## Considerations

Episode transcripts, metadata, and markdown sample are from [Snarp](https://github.com/Snarp)'s [magnus_archives_transcripts](https://github.com/Snarp/magnus_archives_transcripts).

[The Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/) is a podcast written by [Jonathan Sims](https://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/), directed by [Alexander J. Newall](http://rustyquill.com/alexander-j-newall/), and produced under the auspices of [Rusty Quill](https://rustyquill.com/about/). Episode content in the form of episode transcripts is [licensed](https://rustyquill.com/legals/) under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), viewable at the provided link or in the `assets` directory.

At present the prose content in question is found in the `assets` directory (and some copies in files related to testing) - this may change as the project develops. My intention is to separate the code from the fiction very strictly for ease of parsing out whos and whats; the code can be used under the GPL (see `LICENSE.md`), but the fiction falls under the license described above, which has different requirements and caveats.
