This project is intended to provide a RESTful API that will provide Magnus Archives episode transcripts and metadata.

## MVP

The minimum viable product for this project will meet the following criteria:

- Serves endpoints that provide episodes.
  - Episode data should contain the following:
    - episode title
    - episode number
    - season in which episode appears
    - episode transcript

This is the barest-bones initial goal.
